                <p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Lifu Zhang, Seongjoon Moon, Michael Bei, Mark Hu, Daniel Zhang</p>

                <h3>Research Question</h3>
                <p>How did the local cooking methods and ingredients of cuisines change through the exchange of agricultural knowledge or techniques with neighboring regions or ethnic groups of the Dong people?</p>

                <h3>Topic and Local Issue</h3>
                <p>We chose the topic of “Food and Agriculture” as we had identified the issue of lacking awareness of preserving local cooking methods and dishes through the years due to major technological developments.</p>

                <h3>Trip Plan</h3>
                <p>Our plan to increase awareness of the local culture was to venture to Guizhou to conduct interviews with local elders, asking about the changes in Guizhou cuisine throughout the years. We also tested out cooking methods and reviewed the foods that local restaurants had offered to us. To help us further understand Guizhou culture, we also entered the rice fields to use traditional methods to gather ingredients.</p>

                <h3>Research Outcome and Evidence</h3>
                <p>Our general research before the trip was investigating how popular the general food is, comparing it with non-traditional food. We also researched specific dishes that originated from the region. Our action will be evidenced through the showcase of interviews and pictures on our website. Our level of success will be measured based on the quantity of donations made through our website and the amount of knowledge people consume through the information we provide in public.</p>

                <h3>Summary of Team Project</h3>
                <p>​

Our team took a lot of actions to address the issue of loss of traditional culinary culture due to modernization. Before the trip we conducted thorough research investigating local food, identifying and recording the iconic dishes there, and also discovered the concerns such as over modernization.​
By visiting Dong villages in Guizhou, we interacted with local guides elders, chefs, and restaurant owners to understand more clear of the changes of culinary practices and the impact of technological advancements.​
We are aiming to design a mini app accessible to all Chinese users. It records recipes and displays pictures from out trip, and showcase the interviews and displays the pictures on the trip.. WE also have a donation section to support local communities from ​
This comprehensive approach not only documents and preserves traditional recipes but also raises awareness about the cultural significance of these dishes, encouraging support for the preservation of Guizhou’s culinary heritage.​
​</p>
